### Crosstab Assignment
The file "CrosstabHW.R" is the result of the first assignment of this class which was to do a crosstabulation on a dataset of our choice. In this assignment, I created a new variable to turn the interval values of APR into a scale of "Average", "Above Average", and "Below Average" and evaluated the number of baseball, football, men's cross country, and men's basketball teams that fell into each category in a crosstab. I concluded that football had the worst APR scores with most teams below average, while men's cross country had the best scores with most teams above average. Meanwhile, baseball teams tended to have average APR scores while basketball skewed below average but still had a significant number of teams with average APR scores.

### 2-Way ANOVA Assignment
The file "ANOVAHW.R" is the result of the second assignment of this class which was to do a two way ANOVA. I used the same dataset as the previous assignment.
